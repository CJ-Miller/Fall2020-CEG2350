**Where questions are presented, answer them in your lab notes.  For each step, include the command you used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.**  If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab.  These are learning experiences.

If you've lost or forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.
