# Lab 05 - NOT FINALIZED

## Lab Procedure
Document your progress in a plain text file named `Lab05-LastName.txt`  
where LastName is your last name

At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:
```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email

```

**Where questions are presented, answer them in your lab notes.  For each step, include the command you used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.**  If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab.  These are learning experiences.

If you've lost or forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../..) for instructions.

## Part 1: Write Source Code
1. You may choose *Java* or *C* or *C++* to do the following:
* Write source code that prompts the user to enter text / a string from standard input, then outputs the same string back to standard out.  Include your code in your lab write up.
    * I recommend naming the source code file `echo` with the appropriate language extension (ie. `echo.java`, `echo.c`, `echo.cpp`).
    * Code integrity does not matter - you may work together or use things found on the internet or textbooks.
    * Python only coders - you will be happiest in C.  Go about halfway through [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strings-in-c-2/) for starter code.  You'll need to add another print statement before the scan statement to prompt the user to enter a string. 

## Part 2: Compile Source Code
1. Find the location of the C compiler, `gcc`.  Use a command to find out which version of `gcc` is running.  
**Useful commands: `whereis, which, man`**
2. Find the location of the Java compiler, `javac`.  Use a command to find out which version of `javac` is running.  
**Useful commands: `whereis, which, man`**
3. Compile your code using the corresponding compiler.  Write the command you used to compile your source code.
4. Run your program.  Write the command you used to run your compiled program.

## Part 3: Make that Makefile

## Part 4: The Git Part (1 pt)
1. Create a `README.md` in your `Lab05` folder.
2. Use `git` commands to `add`, `commit` and `push` the `Lab05` folder to GitHub.  Write the commands you used in your lab notes.
