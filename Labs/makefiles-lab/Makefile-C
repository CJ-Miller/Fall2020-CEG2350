# This is an example of a Makefile for C in Windows
#   That means paths and commands are configured for Windows, not Linux.

#PROGNAME is a variable that need to be changed to the name of your
#	program.  So if I have a code file named code.c
#	the PROGNAME variable needs to be code.c
#	The rest of this "script" will plug the variable in appropriately
#	To reference your code file
PROGNAME = code.c

#EXENAME is the name of the executable file to run your code
EXENAME = program.exe

#This creates the executable file (what you use to run your code)
$(EXENAME): $(PROGNAME)
	c:/MinGW/bin/gcc -Wall -o $EXENAME $PROGNAME

#run is being defined here as a command we can use.
run: $(EXENAME)
	.\$(EXENAME)

#clean is being defined here as a command we can use
clean:
	del /Q $(EXENAME)
